You can enable popups when hovering over a node.

<!-- This uses 1 and 0 as values instead of yes and no, because someday, I
     may allow for deeper depth of neighbors. Those would use 2+ -->

<!-- It sets two fields, `neighbors.incoming` and `neighbors.outgoing` for
     the same reason. Some day, we may configure those separately, and if so,
     this will be better for backward compatibility. -->
