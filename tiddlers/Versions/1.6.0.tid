* Fixed #66: Broken links in the tutorial
* Fixed #67, #68, #69: Many typos and inconsistencies in tutorial found by @Evolena
* Implemented #70: Graph Tiddler configuration allows you to specify a template to use for popups.
** Also included millisecond configuration.
* Implemented #71: Allowing for popups on edges, though this won't be supported by the standard editable graph, because what an edge's popup would say is too case-dependent.
