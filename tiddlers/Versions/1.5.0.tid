* Introduced many improvements to the modal reached when opening tiddlers in fullscreen mode.
** You can navigate between tiddlers in the modal. It will even maintain its own story.
** That story will have a breadcrumb in the modal to let you backtrack.
** You have access to all the ViewTemplate features, including buttons, info panel, and tags, etc...
** You can edit and save tiddlers in the modal.
* Fixed issue where standard graph's default node when empty didn't actually open settings.
