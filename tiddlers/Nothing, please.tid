title: Nothing, please

Okay, fine!

The filter `--` doesn't actually mean "Nothing, please." It technically means "Take all the filter results we have so far (which is nothing), and remove the '-' result", which //effectively means// "Nothing, please".

And `--` makes for a really concise shorthand.
