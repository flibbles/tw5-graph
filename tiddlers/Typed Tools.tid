title: Typed Tools

! Relink integration

This tool takes advantage of any configuration present due to the [[Relink]] plugin. If Relink specifies a type for a field, this will automatically recognize that type and treat it appropriately.

Even if you don't have Relink installed, this tool will know the type of several core fields. See [[Field Types]] for more information.

There is a suite of tools that work with typed fields.
