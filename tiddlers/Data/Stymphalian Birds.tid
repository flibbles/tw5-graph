These were horiffic birds with beaks, feathers, and claws of bronze or iron. They lived in the marshes of Stymphalus in Arcadie, and they would kill humans by dropping iron feathers onto them.

[[Heracles]] killed them all as one of his Twelve Tasks. He did so by protecting himself with the pelt of the [[Nemean Lion]] and a rattle given to him by Athena.
