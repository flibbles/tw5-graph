tags: Myth Creature Dragon Norse

This gigantic dragon from Norse mythology has many names: "Envy Dragon", "Corpse Eater", and "Dread Biter". It gets these because it's famous for constantly chewing at the roots of Yggdrasil, the life tree which supports the universe.

Come Ragnarok, Nidhogg will be there to help bring about the end.
