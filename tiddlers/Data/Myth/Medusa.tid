Medusa was an innocent Gorgon woman that Poseidon desired. He disguised himself as a white stallion and seduced her somehow in the sacred temple of the goddess Athena. This outraged Athena so much that she changed Medusa into a hideous parody of her former self.

She has the body of a woman, but with wings on her back, great tusks or fangs, and most famously, a head of writhing snakes in place of hair. Her eyes were her most dangerous attribute. Anyone who looked into them would be turned instantly to stone.

She and her sisters lived in seclusion in a hidden place east of Scythia, until [[Perseus]] came by and killed her under the orders of King Polydectes.
