slayed: Minotaur

Theseus was a divine hero famous for slaying the [[Minotaur]] among other feats.

There's also a tale about the Ship of Theseus, how after he returned from Minoan Crete, that ship was kept in the Athenian harbor as a memorial for several centuries. But as it would break down, parts would be replaced one at a time. Over time, the entire ship was replaced piecemeal.

Is it still the same ship?
