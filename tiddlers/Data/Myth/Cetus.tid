The Cetus are a type of serpentine sea monsters. Normally, they're depicted as sea serpents, but other depictions describe them as having the head of a boar or hound, and the body of a whale or dolphin. We're going to go with a sea serpent in this wiki so we can have another kind of [[Dragon]], rather than yet-another [[Chimera]].

Several heroes have had to slay these.

* [[Perseus]] slew one using the head of [[Medusa]] to rescue his future-wife Andromeda.
* [[Heracles]] killed one to save Hesione.
