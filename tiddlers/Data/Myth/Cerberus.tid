Cerberus is the monstrous dog who guards the gates to the underworld. He usually has three heads, but some sources depict him as having as many as fifty. In many tales, getting past Cerberus is a challenge to overcome. Orpheus lulled the dog to sleep with his lyre, while Aeneus drugged the dog.

Heracles was a dick to the dog. As one of his Twelve Tasks, he was to bring Cerberus to the overworld, which he did by choking the dog out and then chaining the dog to Charon's boat. As soon as Cerberus got free, he ran back home.

Its sibling is [[Orthos]].
