The Nemean Lion is a monsterous lion which was a scourge on the region of Nemea, eating humans and livestock alike. It's said to be the offspring of two other monsters: Echidna and Typhon, or Orthrus, or to have been created by the goddess Silene.

This lion was virtuallin indestructible, and one of [[Heracles]]'s first tasks was to slay this creature. Since its pelt could not be penetrated, Heracles had to choke it to death. However, he was then able to use the pelt to protect himself from the iron feathers of the [[Stymphalian Birds]].
