The minotaur, or the "Bull of Minos", has the body of a man, but the head of a huge bull. It's kept in a deep labyrinth beneath the palace of Knossos in the island of Crete. It's born after the King of Minos sacrificed the wrong bull to the gods. As punishment, they caused his wife to fall in love with the Creten bull he was supposed to have sacrificed, and the offspring was the minotaur.

They're very good at mazes.
