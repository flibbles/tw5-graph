TW5-Uglify is a plugin that can minify all the tiddlers in other plugins. This can be very useful for <<.graph>>, because <<.graph>>'s release does not minify any of its javascript or wikitext. However, it is optimized and tested against TW5-Uglify.

It's very simple to use, and if the size of <<.graph>> or any of its engine plugins is a problem, I strongly recommend using this over other options (not just because I wrote it).

If you have a tiddlywiki file you'd like you compress, then after you've installed <<.graph>>, you can drop your file on the [[Uglify Wizard|https://flibbles.github.io/tw5-uglify/uglified.html]], which will spit out your wiki with all plugins neatly compressed.

If you are running a server, install Uglify from its [[project site|https://github.com/flibbles/tw5-uglify]], then install the plugin in your project just like you would any other project. Voila. Your server will now serve compressed plugins without any extra steps.
