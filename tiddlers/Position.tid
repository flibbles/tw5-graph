title: Position

A position indicates a coordinate location using numbers concatenated with commas, such as <<.value 23.5,-12.88>>. The advantage to using these is that since they're a single string value, they can be stored and accessed under a single entry within [[Data Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#DataTiddlers]]. They can be fed directly to the <<.attr $pos>> attribute of <<.wlink NodeWidget>> widgets.

Their format is simple: `$(x)$,$(y)$`.

!! Blank values

Positions support blank values. So <<.value 14>> would indicate x as 14, but y (an any possible additional axes) as unspecified. To leave x blank and specify y, lead with a comma. E.G: <<.value ,16>>.
