Graphs are made up of multiple node objects. Each one is defined by the use of the <<.wlink NodeWidget>> widget. The kinds of [[properties|Graph Properties]] that nodes have will define the behavior and style of individual nodes, such as setting their color, or what happens when you interact with them.

All node objects will correspond to a tiddler in your wiki. This tiddler must be unique, but it does not have to exist.

There is a single pre-defined type of node object used by [[View]]:
