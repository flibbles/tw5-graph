Now we've got a graph that actually looks decent and shows some good information. Maybe now it's time we move it someplace where we'd want to show it, like in a tiddler, and not just in the [[Sidebar]].

Super easy:

<$doc.demo description="graph.view widget" code="""<$graph.view $tiddler="$:/graph/Default" />
""" />

You'll need to prepend your graph's name with <<.value $:/graph/>>. That's because it's possible to create graphTiddlers unrelated to the sidebar, but that's a discussion for another time.

You can check out <<.wlink Graph.ViewWidget>> for more options on how to transclude your graphTiddlers, but the default settings are certainly enough for now.
