title: Neighbors
tags: Concepts

"Neighbors" refers to to nodes connected to a given node (or set of nodes) by edges. Some types of graphs, particularly a [[Live View|Live Graph Template]], will often include the neighbors for its given tiddlers on the graph, even though those nodes are not directly specified themselves.

Currently, <<.graph>> has very shoddy support for neighbors, and must be developed further. After that is done, this page will have more content, and probably examples.
